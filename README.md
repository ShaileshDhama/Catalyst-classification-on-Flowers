# Catalyst Classification on Flowers Dataset

**Author**: SHAILESH DHAMA

### Business problem:

To perform classification and modelling on flowers dataset.

## STEPS :

    - Requirements
    - Setting up GPUs
    - Dataset preprocessing
    - Augmentations
    - Pytorch dataloaders
    - Modelling
    - Model predictions
    - Training with Focal Loss and OneCycle
    - Model inference

## RESULTS :

#### Before Predictions :
